2.  traverse the linked list and extract each element in both the linked list at single time   ,  when will extract 2,at the 
    same time extract 5 as well and save the value in a variable .


3.   put that value in a  newly created linked list with 0 element in it  
            that is   a node will be created with value of 0 intially at the start of the exceution of the code  and suppose that node will be dummynode1.
			

4.   when we traverse the first node of the linkedlist 			
         

sum =  0+2+7 = 7
