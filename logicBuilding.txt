1. 2-->4-->3       2--->4 -->0
   5-->6-->4       2--->4-->5
                   4 -->8--->5 
                       584
    8 --->  0 -->  7

2.  traverse the linked list and extract each element in both the linked list at single time   ,  when will extract 2,at the 
    same time extract 5 as well and save the value in a variable .


3.   put that value in a  newly created linked list with 0 element in it  
            that is   a node will be created with value of 0 intially at the start of the exceution of the code  and suppose that node will be dummynode1.
			

4.   when we traverse the first node of the linkedlist 	 that is when we reach  2  and when we reach 5   
      then we will add both values  ,sum of that will be put in place of 0  ,that 0 will become 7 and then we will create another dummynode2 and put its address in dummynode1.next 

5.   then we move forward in both l1 and l2  then we do l1.next and l2.next 
           then again we add  add values of l1.val and l2.val  	  we will get 10 as sum /any more than digit value .
             then   to get the carry  we will  10/10 = 1  will be the carry , store as global variable 
             and to get one's place we will 10%10 =  0 , which we will put at place of  dummynode2.val =0;	

6.     and we will create new node and  update l1 and l2 value in it.	
        we will  again add l1 and l2 and also add carry to it .
       so if there is no next value available then also will add the carry to the next value and update the dummy node2.val

7.  at last traverse in reverse element and extract each value and print it .	   
         

sum =  0+2+7 = 7
