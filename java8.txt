java 8 

Java 8 introduced several functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package to facilitate functional programming. Here are some commonly used functional interfaces along with examples:

1. **`Supplier<T>`:**
   - Represents a supplier of results, doesn't take any arguments.
   ```java
   import java.util.function.Supplier;

   public class Example {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Supplier<String> messageSupplier = () -> "Hello, World!";
           System.out.println(messageSupplier.get()); // Prints: Hello, World!
       }
   }
   ```

2. **`Consumer<T>`:**
   - Represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result.
   ```java
   import java.util.function.Consumer;

   public class Example {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Consumer<String> printUpperCase = s -> System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());
           printUpperCase.accept("java"); // Prints: JAVA
       }
   }
   ```

3. **`Function<T, R>`:**
   - Represents a function that takes one argument and produces a result.
   ```java
   import java.util.function.Function;

   public class Example {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Function<String, Integer> stringLength = s -> s.length();
           System.out.println(stringLength.apply("Java")); // Prints: 4
       }
   }
   ```

4. **`Predicate<T>`:**
   - Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one argument.
   ```java
   import java.util.function.Predicate;

   public class Example {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Predicate<String> isLengthGreaterThanFive = s -> s.length() > 5;
           System.out.println(isLengthGreaterThanFive.test("Hello")); // Prints: false
       }
   }
   ```

5. **`UnaryOperator<T>`:**
   - Represents an operation on a single operand that produces a result of the same type as its operand.
   ```java
   import java.util.function.UnaryOperator;

   public class Example {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           UnaryOperator<Integer> square = x -> x * x;
           System.out.println(square.apply(3)); // Prints: 9
       }
   }
   ```

6. **`BinaryOperator<T>`:**
   - Represents an operation upon two operands of the same type, producing a result of the same type as the operands.
   ```java
   import java.util.function.BinaryOperator;

   public class Example {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           BinaryOperator<Integer> sum = (x, y) -> x + y;
           System.out.println(sum.apply(3, 4)); // Prints: 7
       }
   }
   ```

These are just a few examples; there are more functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package to cover different use cases in functional programming.


Certainly! In simple terms, a functional interface in Java is an interface that has only one abstract method. It's a special kind of interface introduced in Java 8 to support the new functional programming features. Let's break it down:

1. **Single Abstract Method (SAM):**
   - A functional interface is an interface with exactly one abstract (unimplemented) method. This method is often referred to as the "functional method" or "single abstract method" (SAM).

2. **@FunctionalInterface Annotation:**
   - The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation is optional but can be used to explicitly mark an interface as a functional interface. It helps the compiler catch accidental violations of the single abstract method constraint.

3. **Functional Interface Example:**
   ```java
   @FunctionalInterface
   interface MyFunction {
       int apply(int x, int y);
   }
   ```
   Here, `MyFunction` is a functional interface with a single abstract method called `apply`.

4. **Lambda Expressions:**
   - Functional interfaces are often used with lambda expressions. A lambda expression provides a concise way to express the implementation of the single abstract method.
   ```java
   MyFunction add = (a, b) -> a + b;
   ```

5. **Functional Interface in Java Standard Library:**
   - Java 8 introduced many new functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package, such as `Predicate`, `Consumer`, `Function`, etc. These interfaces provide common functional patterns for various types of operations.

6. **Example Using Built-in Functional Interface:**
   ```java
   import java.util.function.Predicate;

   public class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           Predicate<String> isLengthGreaterThanFive = s -> s.length() > 5;

           System.out.println(isLengthGreaterThanFive.test("Hello")); // false
           System.out.println(isLengthGreaterThanFive.test("Java"));  // true
       }
   }
   ```
   Here, `Predicate` is a built-in functional interface used for boolean-valued functions. The `test` method serves as the single abstract method.

In summary, a functional interface in Java is an interface with a single abstract method, often used in conjunction with lambda expressions to provide a concise way of implementing functional programming constructs. Functional interfaces facilitate the adoption of functional programming principles in Java.



Sure, let's break down lambda expressions in a simple way:

1. **Anonymous Functions:**
   - A lambda expression is a concise way to represent an anonymous function, which means a function without a name.

2. **Syntax:**
   - It has a compact syntax using the arrow `->`. For example: `(parameters) -> expression`.

3. **Parameters and Body:**
   - You can define parameters on the left side of the arrow, and the body of the function on the right side.
   - Example: `(x, y) -> x + y`.

4. **Short and Readable:**
   - Lambda expressions are often used for short, one-time operations. They are particularly handy for writing small and readable pieces of code.

5. **Used with Functional Interfaces:**
   - Lambda expressions are commonly used in conjunction with functional interfaces. A functional interface is an interface with a single abstract method.
   - Lambda expressions provide a way to implement the abstract method of a functional interface concisely.

6. **Example:**
   - Let's say you have a functional interface `Adder` with a method `add`:
     ```java
     interface Adder {
         int add(int a, int b);
     }
     ```
     You can use a lambda expression to implement it:
     ```java
     Adder adder = (x, y) -> x + y;
     ```

7. **Benefits:**
   - Lambda expressions reduce boilerplate code, making your code more expressive and concise.
   - They promote functional programming style in Java, allowing you to treat functions as first-class citizens.

In summary, a lambda expression is a way to write short, anonymous functions in a compact and readable form, commonly used in Java for working with functional interfaces and promoting a more functional programming style.
